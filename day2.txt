Special German Sounds (Umlauts & ß)

 Umlauts (Ä, Ö, Ü)
These letters change pronunciation:

Ä (ae) → Like "e" in "bet" → Mädchen (girl)

Ö (oe) → Like "i" in "bird" → schön (beautiful)

Ü (ue) → Like French "u" → Müde (tired)


The letter ß (Eszett or Sharp S)
Sounds like a double "s" → Straße (street)

In Switzerland, ß is often replaced with "ss".
